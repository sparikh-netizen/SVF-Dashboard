# Spice Village Assistant - Project Context

## Shopify API Rules (apply to ALL Shopify scripts)
- **Costs**: always fetch via `GET /inventory_items/{id}.json` → `cost` field. Never read cost from the product or variant object.
- **Pagination**: always use cursor-based `page_info` pagination with `limit=250`. Never use page-number pagination.
- **Rate limiting**: always add `time.sleep(1)` between batch API calls (Shopify REST = 2 req/s). Always implement 429 retry with `Retry-After` header before continuing.
- **Batch cost fetch**: fetch inventory costs in batches of 100 IDs via `/inventory_items.json?ids=...`. 1s delay between batches, retry on 429.
- **Script execution**: run synchronously. No background tasks in standalone scripts.
- **Record counts**: always log/confirm variant count, order count, and cost coverage before processing.

- Query Shopify and other APIs in real time when asked

## What's built so far

### Bot infrastructure
- `bot.py` — single-file Telegram bot, deployed on Railway (project: cooperative-laughter)
- `requirements.txt` — python-telegram-bot, requests, python-dotenv, anthropic, pytz, google-auth, google-api-python-client
- Natural language intent parsing via Claude Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)
- Whitelist support via ALLOWED_USER_IDS env var

### Shopify (online channel)
- Sales by period: today, yesterday, last 7 days, this week, last week, this month, last month
- Sales by product keyword (searches line item titles)
- Fetches all orders excluding refunded/voided; paginated with Link header support
- Timeout: 30s

### Flour Cloud (retail POS channel)
- Base URL: https://flour.host/v3/documents?limit=1000&type=R&sort=-date
- Date filtering in Europe/Berlin timezone (store POS timezone)
- Skips cancelled items
- Item fields: title (name), amount (qty), totalIncVat (revenue)

### Cross-channel queries
- "retail sales yesterday" → Flour Cloud only
- "online sales last week" → Shopify only
- "total sales this month" → combined figure
- "compare online and retail" → side-by-side breakdown
- All of the above work for product-level queries too

### Gmail search
- Searches 4 inboxes: invoices@, svfproducts@, info@, sparikh@spicevillage.eu
- Auth: service_account.json locally / GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON env var on Railway
- Domain-wide delegation on spicevillage.eu Google Workspace
- Returns top 3 results per inbox with subject, sender, date, direct Gmail link

### Restaurant sales (Google Sheets)
- Spreadsheet ID: `1BiiLjs30NF_O6xZz_O-G4bfgcbQnGP6GuRW12vgJJKo` (stored as `RESTAURANT_SHEET_ID`)
- One tab per month, named "Month YYYY" e.g. "February 2026"
- Row 3: date headers in DD/MM/YYYY format, starting column I (idx 8), one column per day
- "Restaurant sales" row found by searching col D for label (row number varies per month — ~267-276)
- Col E (idx 4) = MTD Actual total; daily value = column matching date in row 3
- Auth: same service account as Gmail (spreadsheets.readonly scope)
- Key functions: `_fetch_restaurant_tab(tab_name, find_date_str)` → `restaurant_sales_all()` → `{"yesterday": float, "mtd": float}`
- Handles month-boundary edge case (yesterday in different tab from current month)

### Daily 4am Briefing
- Scheduled at 04:00 CET/CEST (Europe/Berlin) via `job_queue.run_daily`
- Sends to chat ID configured via `DAILY_REPORT_CHAT_ID` env var
- Reports yesterday's revenue + MTD revenue for: Retail (Flour Cloud), Online (Shopify), Restaurant (Sheets)
- Each source fetched independently — unavailable shown if one source fails
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with 5-minute `asyncio.sleep` between retries (non-blocking)
- Enabled via `python-telegram-bot[job-queue]==20.7` (APScheduler dependency)

### Supplier outstanding (Google Sheets)
- Spreadsheet ID: `1JMfhCB-af8DNnbYNe2Any2oakbNRJHOFvdFZXDMq1qg` (stored as `SUPPLIER_SHEET_ID`)
- One tab per supplier (Transfood, Smart Elite, Shalamar, Swagat, AR Food, IPS, Om Food, Das Vegarma, GFT, Bonesca, Asia Express, Deilght Food, Crown, Kumar Ayurveda, Sona Food, Umer, Aayush, Taya, Aheco, Bakery, Desi Megamart)
- Row 2: col G (idx 6) = TOTAL PAYMENT DUE (overdue), col J (idx 9) = TOTAL PAYMENT BALANCE (all outstanding)
- Row 8: column headers — Invoice Date (B), Invoice No (C), Total Invoice Amount (E), Due by Date (F), Payment 1-4 + dates, Payment Balance (O, idx 14)
- Rows 9+: one row per invoice/credit note; RE... = invoices (positive), GS... = credit notes (negative)
- Outstanding = any row where Payment Balance ≠ 0
- Tab matched by fuzzy search: exact → prefix → substring
- Key functions: `_find_supplier_tab(svc, query)`, `fetch_supplier_outstanding(supplier_name)`, `fmt_supplier_outstanding(data)`
- Intent: `supplier_outstanding` — triggered by "what do we owe X", "outstanding for X", "unpaid invoices X"

## Dashboard (index.html + config.js)

### Google Sheets structure
- `spreadsheetIdPro` (`1fa694tBLbrJbRPQVh0Y9TLKinjSWsLrpOoJININmjXY`) — operational data sheet, tabs:
  - `Pro. Monthly` — monthly P&L summary (Month, Total Sales, Sales_Online[2], Sales_Retail[3], Sales_Restaurant[4], COGS_Online[6], COGS_Retail[7], Net Profit[10], Salary[13], Shipping[14])
  - `Shopify_Orders_Monthly` — Shopify orders by month (Month[0], Total Orders[2], Net Sales[5])
  - `Retail Monthly Sales` — Flour Cloud retail by month (Date[0], Total Sales[2])
  - `Restaurant Monthly Sales` — 3 rows per month: Physical / Wolt / Uber (Date[0], Channel[1], Total Sales[3])
  - `Shopify_SameDay_Monthly` — same-day delivery (Month[0], Total[1], SameDay[2], %[3])
  - `GA4_Device_Weekly`, `GA4_Top_Cities`
- `spreadsheetIdPur` (`1wpntBkyUwS16kkJijmCjgwArD7P-6x3djx-ikBB0BzE`) — purchase data, tab `Dashboard` (rows from idx 4, col 0=date, col 1=amount)

### Annual profitability workbooks (separate from operational sheet)
- 2025: `1_X_YBpjiATBFosxKZxB-FLjSkvQDSjRVedqRjNLGNWs` — monthly P&L tabs + Summary (months as columns, metrics as rows)
- 2026: `17Fg-VINGcFmpIMoqmyizsQQR-fNn55QON_9D5UVSI3I` — currently returns 403 (needs "Anyone with link can view" sharing setting)

### Known data gaps (as of 2026-03)
- `Pro. Monthly` only has Jan–Dec 2025 rows — need to add 2026 monthly rows for Net Profit YTD tile to show
- `Retail Monthly Sales` only has through Jan 2026 (Feb+ missing)
- `Restaurant Monthly Sales` only has through Jan 2026 (Feb+ missing)
- `Shopify_Orders_Monthly` and `Shopify_SameDay_Monthly` are up to Feb 2026

### Security
- Google API key in config.js must be restricted to GitHub Pages referrer in Google Cloud Console
- Shopify token was removed from config.js (was exposed in public repo) — do NOT re-add to any committed file

## Current priorities
1. Picker workflow (order replacements + refunds via Telegram)

---

## Competitor Price Monitor

### Files
- `competitor_monitor.py` — main script, called by bot.py
- `price_monitor_products.csv` — 40 products to monitor (SKU, our_title, search_term, weight, weight_g)

### How it works
- Runs every **alternate day at 07:00 Berlin time** (odd calendar days: 1, 3, 5 … 31)
- Fetches our live prices from Shopify variants API
- Searches **jamoona.com** and **eu.dookan.com** (both are Shopify stores — use `/search/suggest.json` API, no HTML scraping)
- **Matching strategy**: brand-specific first (search "{brand} {type}" and accept only if competitor's title/vendor contains that brand), then generic fallback (search "{type}" and take best weight match)
  - Example: "Anjappar Sona Masoori 10kg" → search "Anjappar sona masoori rice" → finds Anjappar on Jamoona ✓
  - Example: "Annam Sona Masoori 10kg" → Annam not on Jamoona → falls back to "sona masoori rice" → returns Heer (best available)
- Weight matching: ±20% tolerance (e.g. 900g–1100g matches 1kg)
- Email sent to: sparikh@spicevillage.eu AND info@spicevillage.eu

### Email format
HTML table grouped by product category. Color coded:
- 🔴 We're >5% more expensive than cheapest competitor
- 🟡 Within 5%
- 🟢 We're cheapest

### Error handling
- Retries 3 times (30s, 60s delays) before giving up
- On total failure: sends error email to sparikh@spicevillage.eu with full traceback + checklist of what to investigate

### Gmail auth
- Service account: `spice-village-bot@spice-village-bot.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Scope: `https://mail.google.com/` (NOT gmail.send — that scope has a known GCP propagation issue)
- Domain-wide delegation configured in Google Workspace Admin (admin.google.com → Security → API Controls → DWD)
- Sends as/from: sparikh@spicevillage.eu

### Manual test run
```bash
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=... python3 competitor_monitor.py --force
```
`--force` bypasses the alternate-day gate.

---

## COGS Pipeline

### Scripts
- `cogs_pipeline.py` — daily COGS pipeline module (imported by bot.py)
- `weekly_cogs_report.py` — ad-hoc weekly COGS report, run manually from terminal

### Daily pipeline (`cogs_pipeline.py`)
- Runs at **08:00 Berlin time** via `job_queue.run_daily` in bot.py (`send_cogs_report`)
- Pulls yesterday's Shopify orders (Berlin local date, UTC boundaries for API)
- Excludes cancelled orders; refunds remove revenue but keep COGS (damaged goods rule)
- Fetches costs via `inventory_item_id` → locked as `cost_at_sale` in SQLite at time of processing
- Appends one row per product (≥1 unit sold) to Google Sheet — never overwrites
- Sends Telegram summary to `DAILY_REPORT_CHAT_ID`

### SQLite database
- Path: env var `COGS_DB_PATH`, default `./cogs.db`
- **Requires Railway persistent volume** — ephemeral filesystem will lose data on redeploy
- Table: `order_line_items` — primary key `(order_id, line_item_id)`, idempotent on re-run
- Columns: `order_id`, `line_item_id`, `order_date` (Berlin YYYY-MM-DD), `sku`, `title`, `variant_id`, `gross_qty`, `gross_revenue` (ex-VAT), `gross_tax`, `refund_qty`, `refund_revenue` (ex-VAT), `refund_tax`, `cost_at_sale`, `cost_source` ('live' or 'backfill')
- Revenue stored ex-VAT: `gross_revenue = qty × price − tax_lines`. `gross_tax` stored separately to derive inc-VAT.
- Schema migration: `_get_db()` runs `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with try/except for idempotency on existing DBs
- Backfilled Jan 1 – Mar 24 2026: 49,989 rows, 99.8% cost coverage. Jan COGS 60.3%, Feb 59.2%, Mar 59.3% (ex-VAT)
- Used for rolling 7-day and MTD summaries without extra Shopify API calls

### Google Sheet — COGS Shopify
- **Sheet ID:** `1vmL9PXQMgwxEioHAIydtOvRbPwBaF4gQbUsIbfG2Y_A`
- **Tab:** `COGS Daily`
- **Columns:** Date | SKU | Product name | Units sold | Net rev ex-VAT € | Net rev inc-VAT € | COGS € | COGS% ex-VAT | COGS% inc-VAT | GP ex-VAT € | GP inc-VAT €
- Tab auto-created with header if missing. Date-deduplication prevents double-writes.
- Service account: `spice-village-bot@spice-village-bot.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

### Telegram message format (08:00 daily)
```
📊 COGS Report — DD Mon YYYY
📅 Yesterday — Revenue: €X,XXX | COGS: XX.X% | Gross Profit: €X,XXX
📆 Last 7 Days — Revenue: €X,XXX | COGS: XX.X% | Gross Profit: €X,XXX
🗓 Month to Date — Revenue: €X,XXX | COGS: XX.X% | Gross Profit: €X,XXX

```

### Ad-hoc report (`weekly_cogs_report.py`)
- Run manually: `python3 weekly_cogs_report.py 2026-03-18 2026-03-25`
- Fetches costs fresh from Shopify each run (no SQLite)
- Prints to terminal only — does not write to Sheet or Telegram

### 5. Cash Flow Projection
**Sheet ID:** `10UxZLVwIgg0DFurZ-syXktRCHqfM37wPV1VmoJ3nsXE`
**Tabs:** Two main scenarios: `Mar to Dec 2026` (with big loans) and `Mar to Dec 2026 without loan` (Qonto bill discounting only)

**Revenue assumptions (same in both scenarios):**
- Online: €90–100K/month (€80K Dec)
- Retail: €45–50K/month (€40K Dec)
- Restaurant: €15–16K/month (€14K Dec)
- **Total: €150–166K/month, €1,586,000 for the period**

#### Scenario A — With big loans (Wayflyer + Shopify Capital):
- Outflow: €1,839,368 total
- Net operating cash flow: +€65,530 (before debt service)
- Loan repayments: €318,898 (Wayflyer €123K + Shopify €107K + Qonto €51K + others)
- Cash flow after creditors: **-€253,368**
- Loan injections: €220,000 (Shopify €120K in Mar, Wayflyer €100K in Jun)
- Running balance: €81,863 → €45,648 → drops to **-€33,368 in Dec** (goes negative)

#### Scenario B — Without big loans (Qonto bill discounting only):
- Outflow: €1,886,728 (higher due to Qonto interest on each invoice)
- Net operating cash flow: +€55,530
- Loan repayments: €356,258 (Qonto monthly ~€23–35K replaces Wayflyer/Shopify)
- Cash flow after creditors: **-€300,728**
- Loan injection: €311,000 (all Qonto bill discount, monthly €25–40K)
- Running balance: **-€13,137 in Mar** → turns positive May → ends at **+€10,272 in Dec**
- Requires existing cash buffer of at least €15,500 to cover March opening negative

**Why Scenario B is preferred:** No large-principal loans means no lump-sum interest charges. Qonto bill discount charges interest only on the specific invoices discounted (~2.3%), not on a fixed loan amount. Year-end balance is positive vs negative. Total loan injections (€311K) are lower than Scenario A's effective commitment.

**⚠️ Known data error in both scenarios:** "Other Expenses" line (€3,350) and its sub-items (Dooplepack €800 + Sales promotion €1,300 + Amazon €750 + Misc €500 = €3,350) are both counted in Outflow Total, causing **double-counting of €3,350/month = €33,500 overstated for the period**. The actual outflow and deficit is lower than shown.

**Running balance summary — Scenario B:**
| Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| -€13,137 | -€5,352 | +€7,851 | +€7,054 | +€8,257 | +€18,960 | +€32,663 | +€18,866 | +€33,069 | +€10,272 |
