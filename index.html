## Custom Domain (Optional - Advanced)

If you want your own domain like `dashboard.spicevillage.eu`:

1. Buy a domain (or use existing)
2. In your domain's DNS settings, add a CNAME record:
   - Name: `dashboard` (or `www`)
   - Value: `yourusername.github.io`
3. In GitHub Settings → Pages:
   - Enter your custom domain: `dashboard.spicevillage.eu`
   - Click **Save**
4. Wait 10-30 minutes for DNS propagation

## Troubleshooting

### "Your site is having problems building"
- Make sure file is named `index.html` (lowercase)
- Make sure repository is Public
- Check Settings → Pages is enabled

### "404 Not Found"
- Wait 2-5 minutes after enabling Pages
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Make sure file is named `index.html`

### Dashboard shows but data is 0
- Check that your API key is correct in the HTML file
- Make sure Google Sheets are shared as "Anyone with the link → Viewer"
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Changes not showing
- GitHub Pages takes 1-2 minutes to rebuild
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private window

## Advantages of GitHub Pages

✅ **Free** - No cost
✅ **Fast** - CDN-backed hosting
✅ **Reliable** - 99.9% uptime
✅ **Easy** - No server management
✅ **HTTPS** - Secure by default
✅ **Version control** - Track all changes
✅ **Easy updates** - Edit files directly on GitHub

## Security Note

Your API key is visible in the HTML source code, but that's OK because:
- The key is restricted to only Google Sheets API
- Your spreadsheets are already public
- The key can only READ, not write
- You can rotate the key anytime

For extra security, in Google Cloud Console → API Key settings:
- Add **Application restrictions** → **HTTP referrers**
- Add: `https://yourusername.github.io/*`
- This makes the key only work from your GitHub Pages site

## Next Steps

1. Create GitHub account
2. Create repository
3. Upload `index.html` (renamed from dashboard-WORKING-final.html)
4. Enable Pages in Settings
5. Share your live URL!
